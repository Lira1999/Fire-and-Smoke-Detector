# Fire-and-Smoke-Detector
This is a hardware-based project for creating a safe system that detects emergency fire breakouts. 
# Project Description
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The project aims to develop a robust hardware-based fire and smoke detection system utilizing advanced flame detection and smoke sensing technologies. The system is designed to provide early detection of fire emergencies, enabling prompt response measures to mitigate potential risks. <br>
If the flame is detected within 0.8 meters, the alarm buzzes and the door opens up. If smoke is detected, the LED starts to blink attracting people's attention and the buzzer also starts buzzing.
